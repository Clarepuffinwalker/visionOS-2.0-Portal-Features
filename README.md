If you found the model getting cut after downloading, it's because of the volume display limit on the simulator. It can only display around 1.5 meters. 
To make the model show normally, you can either:
1. shrink the model a little bit;
2. Or Go to [Settings] on your simulator, Tap on [Appearance - Display - Appearance - WindowZoom] and change it to [ExtraLarge], so the model can display successfully.
